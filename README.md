Stock Price Prediction Using Visibility Graphs

This project explores a novel approach to analyzing stock price fluctuations using visibility graphs, a method that converts time series data into networks. The focus is on converting stock price data into a graph-based representation and using graph theory to uncover patterns that may help understand market dynamics. The steps include:

    Preprocessing stock price data.
    Generating visibility graphs from time series data.
    Assigning class labels based on graph features.
    Conducting statistical analysis on graph structures to identify trends and patterns.

This study emphasizes the structural differences in graph patterns related to stock price movements, providing a unique perspective for analyzing financial data.
